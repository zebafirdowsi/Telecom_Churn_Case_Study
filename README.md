# Telecom Churn Prediction Case Study

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or switch to a competitor. By accurately predicting churn, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study contains historical data of telecom customers, including various features such as call details, recharge information, usage patterns, and customer demographics. The target variable is the churn status, indicating whether a customer churned or not.

### Data Dictionary

A detailed data dictionary is provided to describe the meaning of each column in the dataset. It includes acronyms and descriptions for features such as average revenue per user (ARPU), minutes of usage (MOU), age on network (AON), and more.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.
- Encode categorical variables into numerical format.
- Scale numerical features if needed.
- Explore correlations between variables.

### Model Building

- Choose appropriate models for churn prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM, XGBoost, etc.
- Train the models using the training data.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- Fine-tune the models using techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

### Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve analysis.
- Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one for deployment.

## Results

- Present the results of model evaluation, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and provide insights into their performance.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for the telecom company to reduce churn and improve customer retention. Suggestions may include:

- Identify high-churn-risk customers and offer targeted incentives or discounts to retain them.
- Improve customer service and address pain points identified in the analysis.
- Introduce loyalty programs or special offers to reward long-term customers.
- Analyze competitors' offerings and pricing strategies to stay competitive in the market.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the case study and emphasize the importance of proactive churn prediction and customer retention strategies in the telecom industry. Highlight any key insights or discoveries made during the analysis and discuss potential areas for further research or improvement.
